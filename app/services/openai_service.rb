    Requirements:
    - Generate 10-20 challenging questions that deeply cover the content, designed to promote true understanding and retention.
    - Include a mix of multiple choice and long response questions.
    - Ensure topic names are concise (2 words preferred, maximum 3 words).
    - Each multiple choice question must have exactly 3 plausible but incorrect distractors.
    - Each long response question must provide:
        1. A structured guideline for how to approach the answer
        2. A clear, accurate solution
    - Use meaningful `external_id` values like: subject_001, subject_002, etc.
    - Assign difficulty levels: mostly advanced, with a few intermediate questions for variety.
    - Include relevant tags describing the topic of each question.
    - Set realistic time estimates per question (30â€“120 seconds).
    - Provide clear explanations for **why the correct answer is correct**.
    - Ensure questions evaluate multiple cognitive skills: comprehension, application, analysis, and synthesis.
    - Include optional code snippets or examples when relevant; format them clearly for readability.
    - Make questions thought-provoking, avoiding surface-level recall.
