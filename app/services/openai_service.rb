    "Educational Objectives & Cognitive Framework:

    - Design questions using Bloom's Taxonomy distribution:
      * Remember/Understand (20%): Essential foundational concepts
      * Apply/Analyze (50%): Real-world application, problem-solving, and concept breakdown
      * Evaluate/Create (30%): Critical thinking, judgment, synthesis, and innovation
    - Focus on deep learning principles: active retrieval, spaced concepts, and transfer learning
    - Address common misconceptions with pedagogically sound distractors
    - Create authentic assessments that mirror real-world application of concepts

    Advanced Question Design Standards:
    - Scenario-based questions requiring application to novel situations
    - Multi-step reasoning problems that build cognitive complexity
    - Include 'What would happen if...' hypothetical scenarios
    - Add metacognitive elements: 'Why might someone incorrectly choose [option]?'
    - Create questions connecting different sections of the material
    - Include analogical reasoning and cross-domain transfer
    - Design distractors based on typical student reasoning errors, not random alternatives

    Question Quality & Authenticity:
    - Prioritize 'why' and 'how' over 'what' - avoid surface-level recall
    - Include current, real-world examples and industry-relevant scenarios
    - Ask learners to explain processes, justify decisions, and generate examples
    - Create questions requiring synthesis of multiple concepts from the text
    - Include comparative analysis: 'Compare and contrast X and Y in terms of...'
    - Add evaluative thinking: 'Assess the effectiveness/validity of this approach...'
    - Design questions that challenge assumptions and promote critical thinking

    Rich Educational Feedback:
    - Provide detailed explanations that teach new insights, not just confirm correctness
    - Explain why each incorrect answer represents a common misconception or reasoning error
    - Include references to specific concepts or sections from the source material
    - Add 'further reflection' elements: 'How does this connect to broader principles?'
    - Create explanations that help learners understand the underlying reasoning process

    Cognitive Challenge Progression:
    - Vary cognitive load throughout the quiz from foundational to complex applications
    - Include questions requiring working backwards from results or outcomes
    - Create problems where learners must eliminate multiple variables or considerations
    - Design questions that require learners to predict consequences or outcomes
    - Add reflective questions about learning process and concept connections

    Technical Requirements:
    - Generate 10-20 challenging thought-provoking questions that deeply cover the content, designed to promote true understanding and retention
    - Include a mix of multiple choice and long response questions
    - Ensure topic names are concise (2 words preferred, maximum 3 words)
    - Each multiple choice question must have exactly 3 plausible but incorrect distractors
    - Each long response question must provide:
        1. A structured guideline for how to approach the answer
        2. A clear, accurate solution
    - Use meaningful external_id values like: subject_001, subject_002, etc.
    - Assign difficulty levels: mostly advanced, with a few intermediate questions for variety
    - Include relevant tags describing the topic of each question
    - Set realistic time estimates per question (30â€“120 seconds)
    - Provide clear explanations for **why the correct answer is correct**
    - Ensure questions evaluate multiple cognitive skills: comprehension, application, analysis, and synthesis
    - Include optional code snippets or examples when relevant; format them clearly for readability"
